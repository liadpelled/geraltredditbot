# geraltredditbot
A Reddit bot that automatically replies to relevant posts in a subreddit.
This bot is named Geralt after Geralt of Rivia the witcher. It scans through latest posts in the desired subreddit, and if a post contains the word 'portal', it automatically replies with Geralt's famous quote from the video game: "Hrrgh, I hate portals". It is not currently active as many subreddits block bots of this kind to prevent uncontrolled spam.
